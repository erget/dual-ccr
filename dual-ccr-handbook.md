## Introduction

This manual describes how to dive using two closed circuit rebreathers (CCR).
Such a dual CCR equipment configuration has both theoretical and practical implications that are explored in this manual alongside recommended practical, in-water work.
The content is written independent of specific CCR models; you need to know each unit that you are diving inside and out in order to operate them both safely in conjunction with one another.

This manual assumes that you are a trimix diver on both CCRs that you will be diving.
It is a prerequisite that you can solve all problems related to a single-CCR failure on each unit; the focus here is not on the individual CCRs, but on safely using both of them together and switching between them.


## Part 1: Dual CCR diving in theory


### Why would you do that?

CCRs vastly extend the time divers can spend underwater, as well as their range.
Because every system can fail, it is always necessary to take sufficient bailout in order to survive a catastrophic failure of the CCR unit; a non-exhaustive list of examples of reasons why it might be necessary to bail include failures in the scrubber, gas supply issues, or flooding.

The simplest form of bailout is using an open-circuit (OC) scuba tank that is carried with the diver.
This tank contains a known gas.
It has all the disadvantages of OC gas use - limited gas supply, fixed gas mixture, dry and cold gas, etc.
As a result, large amounts of backup gas must be carried for dives that go deep, penetrate long, or combine these.
Additionally, multiple gases must be carried on decompression dives to allow the diver to switch to an optimal gas at different stages of their decompression.
Each gas must be breathed at the right depth, which also means that the diver on bailout must always switch to the right gas at the right time and depth, which can itself be a challenge.

Carrying this amount of gas requires a lot of equipment, all of which must be maintained.
The tanks must be filled, transported to the dive site, and they produce additional drag during the dive, as well as occupying equipment stowage space.
After the dive the same concerns apply. More tanks are more burden.

Some teams mitigate the burden of needing high amounts of bailout gas by distributing the bailout gas amongst the various team members; however, this is not without its risks.
What happens if a diver is lost?
How are the in-water bailout procedures executed?
Does this work inside a narrow wreck or cave tunnel?
Not only is the risk of not having access to the needed gas higher when the diver doesn't carry all the necessary bailout themselves; the execution of gas sharing procedures can be more complex than anticipated, especially in an emergency.

CCRs already solve many of the issues of OC diving for nominal scenarios; therefore a second CCR can solve the same issues as a bailout unit if used correctly.

Additionally, CCRs can offer additional safety in terms of probability of mechanical failure.
Any system can fail, and bailout systems are designed to be available in the case that the primary life support system fails.
However, the bailout system itself is also susceptible to failure.
In the case of OC bailout systems, the bailout can be understood as a linear system in which the failure of a single component renders the entire system inoperable.
Although the likelihood of failure is low, its impact would be very high!
Applying mechanical risk-of-failure analysis to OC vs closed-circuit (CC) bailout systems[^1], it becomes clear e.g. that when using 5 OC bailout tanks, the mechanical risk of failure is 1.5-2.1 as high, depending on how the bailout CCR is configured.

With a bailout CCR, a diver can carry all of the gas they need in a single system that offers all the advantages of CCR diving and significantly reduces the amount of OC gas necessary to complete challenging dives.


### What are the challenges?

While a bailout CCR removes many of the mechanical points of failure, it is still not immune to failure.
Human failure in terms of falsely executed procedures can prove fatal.
You are already familiar with the additional procedural complexity of diving with CCRs and are proficient in executing these on at least 2 units.
You must be able to execute these procedures even when you are extremely distracted. When combining CCRs, there are additional concerns, such as

* Monitoring the second CCR to ensure that it is always breathable, i.e. has a safe gas mixture and is not flooded
* Switching safely between CCRs, both for routine monitoring and in an emergency
* Managing decompression schedules across 2 rebreathers

The equipment requirements for using 2 CCRs are exactly that - 2 CCRs.
CCRs can be mounted on the back, side, or chest, and many combinations exist - backmount and sidemount, backmount and chestmount, even dual backmount!
The guidelines presented in this manual can be applied to any combination of CCRs; no assumption is made as to what model you will use or how it will be configured, only that you have mastered the use of that unit in the configuration you intend to use it in.


## Dive procedures

When diving using CCR bailout, you may need to switch to your backup CCR at any time.
Therefore it is important that your CCR is operable at all times, and that it contains a breathable gas.
The procedures outlined here are designed to make the CCR as predictable as possible.
Among other things this means preventing the CCR's gas content from changing in ways that you are not conscious of.
For this reason we recommend using a lower SP than would be the case than diving a single CCR; this prevents the CCR from injecting O2 at impractical times, wasting gas and affecting buoyancy.
We also recommend against using constant mass flow (CMF) valves because when they are used without being breathed, the loop slowly fills with oxygen.

Some CCRs have a bailout mode which can make their use as a bailout CCR easier.
These modes have their own risks, depending on how they are implemented.
For example, some CCRs detect when the PO2 drops below a certain threshold and switches into active mode to ensure a minimal PO2.
Other units completely turn off electronic PO2 control when the bailout mode is active.
Whatever the case, always verify the loop gas is breathable when switching onto a CCR, and if you are switching onto a CCR in bailout mode, ensure that you deactivate bailout mode after you switch onto it.

Above are just two examples of functionalities of bailout modes, there may be more or those may be subject to change as the CCR manufacturers keep developing and changing their electronics.
Consequently, make sure to read and understand exactly how the units you intend on using operate. 


### Pre-dive

Dual-CCR diving is CCR diving, but with an additional CCR.
Like with any dive, each piece of equipment needs to be ready to dive in its entirety, meaning that you should execute the entire pre-dive checklist for each CCR as if you were diving only that CCR.
The use of checklists is strongly encouraged; it is not without reason that checklists are used extensively in spaceflight, aeronautics, and nautical operations.
Using a checklist does not mean that you don't know the system; it means that you respect the system's complexity, understand it well enough to make or obtain a valid checklist, and that you are conscious of your own human fallibility.

If you are offboarding your diluent in one of your CCRs and that offboard gas is also used as an OC bailout source, ensure that the offboarding tank has sufficient gas to provide you with all the diluent you will need in that CCR as well as allow you to use it as an OC gas source while switching between CCRs at the deepest point in your dive.
Note that when onboarding diluent from an OC tank you are reducing your bailout system's total redundancy due to your reliance for diluent on the regulator attached to the OC tank.
Thich increases the risk of system failure and needs to flow into your risk analysis.

Decompression planning is the same as with a single CCR, with the additional complexity that if you are using a CCR controller as a decompression computer, you will still need to calculate your decompression schedule during the dive even if you switch to a different CCR.
This can be achieved by calculating your PO2 without reading your loops, e.g. by using an independent computer or by setting the computer on your bailout CCR to bailout mode; it can also be achieved by matching the PO2 in both of your loops so that the decompression schedule for the bailout CCR is similar to that of your primary CCR up to the point that you need to bailout.

Broadly speaking, 2 approaches can be used for planning dual-CCR dives, explained below.


#### Using the second CCR only for emergencies

Using this approach, 1 CCR is the primary and the other is the backup.
The reasoning here is that both CCRs should be able to complete the dive, and leaving the scrubber in the backup CCR mostly untouched makes it easier to manage scrubber use.
If the nominal plan is to stay on the primary CCR throughout the dive - only switching in order to perform checks - then the backup CCR needs to have enough capacity (scrubber supply, O2, & diluent) to safely complete the dive if you need to switch to it at the deepest / farthest point in the dive.

You must always have sufficient OC bailout gas to allow you to switch to a known gas and have time to solve problems before switching between CCRs.
This is because an emergency might arise very quickly, and you may need to switch off of your primary CCR without having enough gas in your lungs to blow out the loop of the bailout CCR so that you can switch to it cleanly.
OC bailout provides a known gas mix without needing to monitor sensor readouts and can deliver gas via the demand valve even when your lung is empty, providing you with the crucial gas and time to switch to your bailout CCR.


#### Using both CCRs for extreme extended range

This approach is similar to the use of OC sidemount tanks, in that in the nominal plan both units are used equally.
The diver switches CCRs at chosen intervals (e.g. every 30 or 60 minutes).
The logic is the same as described above, in that at the worst possible time, if a CCR fails, the second CCR still has sufficient O2, diluent, and scrubber time to ensure safe completion of the intended dive.

This adds complexity, but brings the advantage of being able to push the range of the dive in terms of time and duration even further.

For example: The total planned runtime of a dive is 6h, but each CCR's scrubber is only designed to last 4.5h.
In such a dive the individual scrubber time of each unit would be insufficient.
By using both CCRs, the dive can still be conducted while respecting scrubber time and having a bailout system available at all times to complete the dive at the worst possible time of failure.
If after 3h of runtime one CCR fails and both units were used evenly for a total of 1.5h each, the backup CCR still has 3h of scrubber time remaining, allowing a safe exit even if this requires executing a full 3h of planned decompression.

It is not possible to safely plan the use of both CCR's scrubber capacities completely, as this would mean that at a certain point of the dive, all of the bailout capacity would have been used.
However, it is possible to significantly extend dive times by planning - carefully - to use the capacity of both CCRs with error margins.


### On the dive

Before you begin the dive, all checks must be completed on both CCRs. Among other things this will be

* Diluent injection
* O2 injection
* Loop integrity

The specific checks will depend on your CCRs and their configuration; you may be using either of the CCRs to sustain your life, so check it like your life depends on it.


#### Descent

As you descend, the gas in both of your CCRs will compress.
You need to manage the loop volume to both in the primary CCR as well as in the backup CCR.
If the backup CCR has an automatic diluent valve (ADV) or anti-crush system, that is helpful; nevertheless we recommend keeping the loop volume under careful control, injecting diluent manually and being mindful of the rebreather's buoyancy.

When the ambient pressure makes the diluent PO2 higher than your low SP, flush the backup rebreather's loop with diluent.
If this is not done, the backup rebreather may contain a hyperoxic gas.
At this point the diluent's oxygen should be sufficient to keep the rebreather from injecting oxygen, meaning that you don't need to manage its PO2 during the descent, only its integrity and buoyancy.


#### Bottom phase

Once reaching the bottom of your dive, ensure that your bailout CCR is still intact using the same techniques that you've used throughout the descent.
This means that the CCR needs to contain a breathable gas mix and it cannot be flooded.
After completing all checks that precede a loop switch, breathe from your bailout CCR for full certainty that it is indeed working.
If you are using that CCR's computer to track your decompression in case you need to bail, you may want to bring the loop content up to your high SP, either using the electronics or manually.
After this is complete, switch back to the primary loop. We recommend switching the CCR back to its low SP so that it isn't injecting O2 at unexpected points.

If your dive has multiple levels, be aware that you will either need to use an independent computer for accurate decompression calculations, or that your bailout rebreather's computer is likely to have a different decompression schedule than your primary because the PO2 will fluctuate more with ambient pressure in the unit you are not breathing.
In this case, it is better to leave the unit containing a PO2 below your high SP to decrease the risk that the loop becomes hyperoxic.


#### Ascent

On the ascent, vent both CCRs as necessary in order to maintain the desired buoyancy.
The gas in the bailout CCR will expand with decreasing ambient pressure.
It can be easiest to switch onto the bailout CCR occasionally in order to vent through your nose and bring the SP up to a desired level.

At latest, it will be necessary to manage the loop gas manually when the diluent PO2 drops below your low SP.
At this point, switch onto the bailout CCR briefly in order to circulate the loop gas and bring the PO2 in the loop up to your high SP.
Depending on the depth from which you ascend, this may be necessary multiple times.
We recommend bringing the PO2 to your high SP but leaving the SP that is maintained by electronics in the bailout CCR set to low so that the CCR doesn't begin injecting O2 unexpectedly.


### Post-dive

After the dive, perform the complete maintenance procedures on both rebreathers, including tracking scrubber use times and cycling out consumables as needed.


### Conclusions

Diving 2 CCRs opens new horizons for depth and penetration.
Put simply, it makes dives possible that would not be feasible using OC bailout.
This comes at the non-trivial cost of additional complexity and requires significant practice, including of skills that you may consider basic and feel that you mastered long ago.
This is due to higher task loading and additional buoyancy sources; do not be surprised as you struggle, it is a sign of your learning and growth.
Enjoy the new capabilities that this equipment setup opens for you, practice amply, and complete challenging dives when the dive itself is a challenge, rather than the procedural aspects of managing a dual CCR setup.


## Practicals

The procedures listed below should be mastered blind before using a dual CCR configuration in earnest.
Some need to be executed on every dual-rebreather dive; some are necessary only in emergencies.
Ensure that even these emergency skills are executed smoothly and intuitively, as in an emergency, the universe is already trying to kill you - your skills shouldn't get in the way as well.


### Depth changes

1. Maintain loop integrity and appropriate loop volume by injecting diluent so that the loop does not flood as pressure increases
1. Prevent loop from becoming hypoxic or hyperoxic at all phases of the dive
1. Flush bailout CCR loop with diluent when diluent PO2 exceeds low SP
1. Maintain PO2 well above low SP on ascent by circulating gas and bringing the loop to its high SP on the bailout CCR
1. Decrease loop volume as gas expands on ascent


### Rebreather switches

In most cases it is possible to switch between CCR units directly, without requiring an OC transition source.
If in doubt as to the integrity of your target CCR, get on your OC bailout first, then perform the necessary checks before switching from OC to CC.

Once you are stable and ready to switch, either from your primary CCR or from your OC bailout, switch onto the other CCR as follows:

1. Ensure that the CCR is not flooded
1. Ensure the loop has sufficient volume and is at ambient pressure
1. Check that the target CCR contains a breathable gas
1. Blow out the target CCR's dive-surface valve, then open the loop while breathing
1. Bring the unit's PO2 to its desired level and switch to high SP
1. Check through all computers to make sure that the CCR computers are in the correct mode and that any independent computer is tracking the PO2 that you are breathing

Practice transitioning between CCRs using both techniques.
